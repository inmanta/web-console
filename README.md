# Inmanta web console

This project is the current frontend of for the inmanta service orchestrator. The eventual goal is to replace the current dashboard entirely.

The console is developed in typescript using react and redux (through [easy peasy](https://easy-peasy.now.sh/)). Testing is performed using cypress.

## UX Guideliness

The frontend uses the (patternfly v4 framework)[https://www.patternfly.org/v4/] for its UI components. The choice of the framework is motived by:

- Use by many (mostly RedHat backed) infra products (Cockpit, Openstack, Openshift, Keycloack, ...) The advantage of this is that the scope of the component is similar and the design will have some familiarity.
- There are extensive UX guideliness included with the project both in general and per component.

## Development setup

    yarn # install dependencies

    yarn build # build the project

    yarn start # start the development server

    yarn test # run the test suite

    yarn lint # Run the linter

    yarn format # Run the code formatter

    yarn bundle-profile:analyze # Launch a tool to inspect the bundle size

    yarn cypress-test # Run tests with Cypress

To enable authentication with keycloak, you can use environment variables, e.g. add the following variable to a dotenv (`.env` in the root of the project) file (further information on <https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv>)

    SHOULD_USE_AUTH=true

You can also specify the url of the keycloak server in the same file:

    KEYCLOAK_URL=<Your keycloak server url>

Alternatively, the keycloak parameters can also be specified in an external file in the production environment, called config.js, following the example src/config.js file.

The base url of the backend services can also be specified here, e.g.:

    API_BASEURL=http://localhost:8888

Cypress can be configured via cypress.json (or command line arguments), e.g. to record videos of each test run:

    "video": true

### Pre-commit hook

`husky` configures the git hooks. https://github.com/typicode/husky  
`lint-staged` runs scripts on matched staged source files. https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged  
There is no need to manually configure anything. Just by installing the dependencies, the git hooks are configured.

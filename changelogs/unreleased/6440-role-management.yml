  Add support for role management to user management page.
  
  This feature allows to assign and manage user roles directly from the web console.
  
  Note: Role management is only supported when using the database authentication method in combination with the policy-engine authorization provider.
  
  See the [Inmanta documentation](https://docs.inmanta.com/inmanta-service-orchestrator-dev/9/administrators/authorization.html#integration-with-database-authentication) for details on configuring roles and permissions.

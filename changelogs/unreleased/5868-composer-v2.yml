description: "Complete redesign of the Instance Composer, main focus was to align its general functionalities with regular form, and improve the user experience. 
This change includes: 
A right sidebar, to have better access to the form fields of different parts of the instance
A left sidebar, from which we can drag and drop embedded entities and existing Inter-Service Relations from the inventory.
Inter-Service Relations can only be edited when opened individualy in the Instance Composer.
Zooming can now be done with a slider, and two new functionalities have been added. Zoom-to-fit and full-screen mode."

     * The specific feature that was causing the issue was
     * the contructor parameter properties shorthand.
     * With this you can just specify the contructor
     * parameters and the class properties are automatically
     * created and set.
     *
     * I believe babel for storybook has been configured to understand
     * TypeScript. But it might just remove typescript syntax.
     * And sometimes we need certain typescript code to result
     * in actual javascript code changes. This plugin fixes it.

## Entities

Entities relate to all different data requirements within the application.  
These are all different entities within our design:

- Projects
- Environments
- Services
- Service
- Instances
- Resources
- Events
- Logs
- Config
- Diagnostics
- ...

Each entity has a Redux state slice where it is stored.

Each entity has either a Query, a Command or both.

- A `Query` needs a `QueryManager` which needs a `StateHelper` and the `ApiHelper`
- A `Command` needs a `CommandManager` which needs a `StateHelper` and the `ApiHelper`

All of these classes are entity specific except for the ApiHelper.

## StateHelper

The `StateHelper` is responsible for getting and setting state.  
It doesn't own any data because we keep the data in a redux store instance.  
It's an adapter around the redux store for 1 specific entity.

## QueryManager

The `QueryManager` is reponsible for handling the query and its related data.  
It uses the `StateHelper` and `ApiHelper` to update data.

## CommandManager

The `CommandManager` is reponsible for handling the command and its related data.  
It uses the `StateHelper` and `ApiHelper` to save and update data.

## ApiHelper

The `ApiHelper` is responsible for interaction with the API. It has 1 implementation for all entities.  
This is the class doing actual fetch calls. This is the class that is being mocked during testing.

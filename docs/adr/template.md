# [short title of solved problem and solution]

- Status: proposed
- Date: 14.02.2024

Technical Story:

Currently, we manage all of the queries to the backend ourselves, which is burdened with a lot of code scattered all around the place.
The code is hard to read, requires high effort to learn the flow, possible bugs or unwanted behavior is hard to track, finally adding new queries requires a lot of boilerplate code.

## Context and Problem Statement

[Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.]

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

- [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, ...]
- ... <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

1. React Query
2. RTK Query
3. SWR

- ... <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | ... | comes out best (see below)].

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, ...]
- ...

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, ...]
- ...

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### [option 1]

[example | description | pointer to more information | ...] <!-- optional -->

- Good, because [argument a]

### [option 3]

[example | description | pointer to more information | ...] <!-- optional -->

- Good, because [argument a]
- Good, because [argument b]
- Bad, because [argument c]

## Overview <!-- optional -->

[general overview of the process of decision making.]

## Links <!-- optional -->
